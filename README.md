**`Aspiring Software Engineer - CS Student`**

 I'm a passionate CS student who loves programming and building web apps. I specialize in using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and Firebase to create robust and scalable applications. In my free time, I enjoy taking online programming courses to better prepare myself for future internships and engineering jobs. Some of the languages and technologies that I have experience with include Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, ReactJS, and React Native. I'm set to graduate from the University of Oklahoma in May of 2026 with a degree in Computer Science. If you're interested in learning more about my work or just want to say hi, feel free to check out my GitHub profile or reach out to me.
